I'm currently a Clinical Research Coordinator at Stanford University working with [Dr. Anthony Wagner](https://memorylab.stanford.edu/) and [Dr. Beth Mormino](https://med.stanford.edu/mormino-lab.html). 

I recently applied to Cognitive Psychology graduate programs to start in Fall 2025. 

My research interests lie in how we leverage memories to anticipate future experiences and the subsequent consequences of our memory-guided predictions to learning and memory.
